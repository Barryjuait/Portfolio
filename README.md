# Portfolio

This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.
Several projects have been developed on Matlab, Python and Arduino.

## Contents

### Unsupervised Learning:
- Pulsar Dataset HTRU2: (https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/HTRU2_analysis.ipynb)
  * In this project I go through descriptive analysis, predictive analysis and dimensionality reduction procedures to describe two types of Neutron Stars from different features of an astronomical dataset. Available in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2.
  
- Supervised Learning: 
  * . 
  
### Time series:
- Sleep Stages Analysis from EEG signals: (https://github.com/Barryjuait/SleepGit)
  * In this project I aimed to detect and classify through Machine Learning classical stages of 
  the sleep-wake cycle from mouse data provided by Dr. Dipesh Chaudhari, NYUAD http://www.chaudhurylab.org/.
  
- Eye tracking Analysis: 
  * Here I designed a routine to detect "most-seen" regions of a picture from a public dataset provided by Tobii. 

- Movement detection and classification from Accelerometers:
  * From rodents data:
  * From humans data (wearables):

- Detection of rotational behavior from video tracking:
  * Routine to detect the rotations often observed in animal models of L-DOPA-induced dyskinesia


### Object-directed projects:
- Lickometer:
  * How to build a capacitive sensor to detect each lick of a rodent in a water spout: 
  https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Lick-o-meter
  
- Commutator for Electrophysiology:
  * How to build an affordable commutator for electrophysiology
  
- Skinner box:
  * For decision-making research (GO/NO-GO task):
