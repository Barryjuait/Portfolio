# Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. Here, you can explore a collection of my academic and personal projects, including Python, Matlab, and Arduino projects. Although the datasets I used are very diverse, these projects showcase my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Feel free to take a look and contact me if you want to give me feedback or if you have a cool project we can team up on. This portfolio is still under construction.


## Contents

- [Stars Classification:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/HTRU2_analysis.ipynb)
  * In this project I go through an astronomical dataset containing different features that describe neutron stars. I performed data cleaning, descriptive analysis, basic statistics, cool visualizations, PCA, and predictive analysis using different unsupervised models for classification.

- [Boston Housing Value:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Estimating_Prices_in_Boston_with_Supervised_Models.ipynb)
  * Here I used different supervised models to estimate the price of properties in Boston using multivariate data. I performed feature selection and used different metrics to evaluate the performance of the models tested.

- [Fake News Detection:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Fake_News_Detection_from_Press_Analysis.ipynb)
  * I developed a platform to classify News (from american Press newspapers) as Fake or Not Fake. The text was explored and organised accordingly to work with different supervised models for classification. The models were compared in terms of Accuracy, Loss and F1.

- [Detection of Behavioral States Using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Dysk_MLP.ipynb)
  * Here I implemented a 1D CNN on a dataset containing the brain activity of a rat model of Parkinson's disease. The results suggest that the side effects of the medication used for Parkinson's disease share a similar pattern of brain activity seen with other drugs that target the dopaminergin system. Those patterns of electrical activity could be used to forecast the severity of those side effects, and therefore adjust the dose of the drug to subthreshold levels.

- [Sleep Stages Classifier from EEG signals:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/SleepGit)
  * In this project, I built an automatic classifier for the different stages of the sleep-waking cycle (Waking, NREM and REM) using mouse electrophysiological data provided by Dr. Dipesh Chaudhari, NYUAD http://www.chaudhurylab.org/. Write me if you want to request access to the repository.

- [Stock Prices Forecasting:](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1aVaUI125giafvNOtFhMPn-Z1UpW2WU9D#scrollTo=BjOUlr1JXaaj.ipynb)
  * Use of 1D CNN for Stock Prices of Tesla.
 
- [Predictive Analysis on Clinical Diabetes Data:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Clinical_Data_on_Diabetes.ipynb)
  * Use of different ML models to evaluate muultivariate analysis on Diabetes.
    
- [Detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Detection_of_Fraudulent_Transactions.ipynb#scrollTo=OlTL8yl3SctL.ipynb)
  * Use of various regression models for the detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions.
 
- [Assessment of Adverse Effects of COVID vaccines on medical records:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/COVIDadverse.ipynb)
  * Used NLP models it was possible to evaluate to what extend vaccines affected different demographics.
 
- [Use of Automatic Speech Recognition to determine speech speed in youtube videos:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Youtube_Analysis/YoutubeAnalysis.ipynb)
  * Use of OpenAI model Whisper to extract transcripts and word timestamps from speech in youtube videos.

- [Segment Anything Model (SAM) for Detection of Lung Cancer Organoids:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/SAM_Organoids.ipynb)
  * Fine Tuning of Meta's Segment Anything Model (Deep Learning) to create masks for segmentation of individual organoids in culture.
  
- [Eye tracking Analysis: ](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/tree/master/Eyetracking)
  * Here I designed a routine to detect "most-seen" regions of a picture from a public dataset provided by Tobii. Basically the code follows the movement of the eyes of people watching a scene.

- Movement detection and classification from Accelerometers:
  * In this code I detect movement bouts from accelerometer data. Movement speed, distance and duration reveal the posibility for classification of the bouts in different classes.
 
- Detection of rotational behavior from video tracking (Matlab):
  * Routine to detect the rotations often observed in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

- [Lickometer:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Arduino/Lick-o-meter)
  * How to build a capacitive sensor to detect each lick of a rodent in a water spout (Arduino) 
  
- Commutator for Electrophysiology (Arduino):
  * How to build an affordable commutator for electrophysiology
  
- Skinner box (Arduino):
  * For decision-making research (GO/NO-GO task):
