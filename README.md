# Portfolio

This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.
Several projects have been developed on Matlab, but also on Python and Arduino.

## Contents
- Sleep Stages Analysis from EEG signals: (https://github.com/Barryjuait/SleepGit)
  * In this project I aimed to detect and classify through Machine Learning classical stages of 
  the sleep-wake cycle from mouse data provided by Dr. Dipesh Chaudhari, NYUAD http://www.chaudhurylab.org/.
- Eye tracking Analysis: 
  * Here I designed a routine to detect "most-seen" regions of a picture from a public dataset provided by Tobii.
