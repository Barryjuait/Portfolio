# Portfolio

This repository contains some of the projects I have worked on for academic, self-learning, and hobby purposes.
Everything has been developed either on Matlab, Python and Arduino.

## Contents

### Unsupervised Learning:
- [Pulsar Dataset HTRU2](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/HTRU2_analysis.ipynb)
  * In this project I go through descriptive analysis, predictive analysis and dimensionality reduction procedures to describe two types of Neutron Stars from different features of an astronomical dataset. Available in https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HTRU2.
  
### Supervised Learning: 
- [Boston Housing](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Estimating_Prices_in_Boston_with_Supervised_Models.ipynb)
  - Here I used different supervised models to estimate the price of properties in Boston using multivariate data.
- [Fake News Detection](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Fake_News_Detection_from_Press_Analysis.ipynb)
  - Using different supervised models, I developed a platform to classify News (from american Press newspapers) as Fake or Not Fake.
- [Detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Detection_of_Fraudulent_Transactions.ipynb)
  - Using similar approaches as above, I tested different predictive models for the detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions.

### Deep Learning:
- [Detection of Behavioral States Using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Dysk_MLP.ipynb)
  - Here I implemented 1D CNN to forecast specific behavioral states the brain activity of a rat model of Parkinson's disease.
   
### Analysis of Time series:
- [Sleep Stages Analysis from EEG signals:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/SleepGit)
  - In this project, I built in Matlab an automatic classifier of the Waking, NREM and REM sleep stages from mouse electrophysiological data provided by Dr. Dipesh Chaudhari, NYUAD http://www.chaudhurylab.org/. Write me if you want to request access to the repository.
  
- [Eye tracking Analysis: ](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/tree/master/Eyetracking)
  - Here I designed a routine to detect "most-seen" regions of a picture from a public dataset provided by Tobii. Basically the code follows the movement of the eyes of people watching a scene.

- Movement detection and classification from Accelerometers:
 - In this code I detect movement bouts from accelerometer data. Movement speed, distance and duration reveal the posibility for classification of the bouts in different classes.
 
- Detection of rotational behavior from video tracking (Matlab):
  * Routine to detect the rotations often observed in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

### Object-directed projects:
- [Lickometer:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Arduino/Lick-o-meter)
  * How to build a capacitive sensor to detect each lick of a rodent in a water spout (Arduino) 
  
- Commutator for Electrophysiology (Arduino):
  * How to build an affordable commutator for electrophysiology
  
- Skinner box (Arduino):
  * For decision-making research (GO/NO-GO task):
