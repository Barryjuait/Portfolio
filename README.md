# Portfolio

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio. Here, you can explore a collection of my academic and personal projects, including Python and Matlab scripts, Arduino projects, and even Excel work. Although the datasets I used are very diverse, these projects showcase my technical skills and problem-solving abilities. Feel free to take a look and contact me if you want to give me feedback or if you have a cool project we can team up on.


## Contents

- [Stars Classification:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/HTRU2_analysis.ipynb)
  - In this project I go through an astronomical dataset containing different features that describe neutron stars. I performed data cleaning, descriptive analysis, basic statistics, cool visualizations, PCA, and predictive analysis using different unsupervised models for classification.

- [Boston Housing Value:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Estimating_Prices_in_Boston_with_Supervised_Models.ipynb)
  - Here I used different supervised models to estimate the price of properties in Boston using multivariate data. I performed feature selection and used different metrics to evaluate the performance of the models tested.

- [Fake News Detection:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Fake_News_Detection_from_Press_Analysis.ipynb)
  - I developed a platform to classify News (from american Press newspapers) as Fake or Not Fake. The text was explored and organised accordingly to work with different supervised models for classification. The models were compared in terms of Accuracy, Loss and F1.

- [Detection of Behavioral States Using 1D Convolutional Neural Networks](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Dysk_MLP.ipynb)
  - Here I implemented a 1D CNN on a dataset containing the brain activity of a rat model of Parkinson's disease. The results suggest that the side effects of the medication used for Parkinson's disease share a similar pattern of brain activity seen with other drugs that target the dopaminergin system. Those patterns of electrical activity could be used to forecast the severity of those side effects, and therefore adjust the dose of the drug to subthreshold levels.

- [Detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions:](https://colab.research.google.com/github/Barryjuait/blob/master/Personal%20Projects/Detection_of_Fraudulent_Transactions.ipynb)
  - Using similar approaches as above, I tested different predictive models for the detection of Fraudulent Credit Card Transactions.


   
- [Sleep Stages Analysis from EEG signals:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/SleepGit)
  - In this project, I built in Matlab an automatic classifier of the Waking, NREM and REM sleep stages from mouse electrophysiological data provided by Dr. Dipesh Chaudhari, NYUAD http://www.chaudhurylab.org/. Write me if you want to request access to the repository.
  
- [Eye tracking Analysis: ](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/tree/master/Eyetracking)
  - Here I designed a routine to detect "most-seen" regions of a picture from a public dataset provided by Tobii. Basically the code follows the movement of the eyes of people watching a scene.

- Movement detection and classification from Accelerometers:
 - In this code I detect movement bouts from accelerometer data. Movement speed, distance and duration reveal the posibility for classification of the bouts in different classes.
 
- Detection of rotational behavior from video tracking (Matlab):
  * Routine to detect the rotations often observed in animal models of Parkinson's disease.

- [Lickometer:](https://github.com/Barryjuait/Barryjuait/blob/master/Arduino/Lick-o-meter)
  * How to build a capacitive sensor to detect each lick of a rodent in a water spout (Arduino) 
  
- Commutator for Electrophysiology (Arduino):
  * How to build an affordable commutator for electrophysiology
  
- Skinner box (Arduino):
  * For decision-making research (GO/NO-GO task):
